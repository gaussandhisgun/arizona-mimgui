# arizona-mimgui

An effort to rewrite Arizona RP's horrible interfaces in Mimgui and Lua. Because CEF is never the way. Never.

Usage: drag and drop the .lua into moonloader.

Do note that this piece of software is in **ALPHA**, is provided **AS-IS** and i take **NO** responsibility if something happens to your Arizona account. I just hate CEF. And Javascript.
